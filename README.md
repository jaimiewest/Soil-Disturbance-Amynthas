Abstract

Earthworms are soil ecosystem engineers due to their consumption, burrowing, and casting behaviors that restructure the soil environment. However, the Asian pheretimoid Amynthas tokioensis and Amynthas agrestis are ecologically distinct from the more widely studied European Lumbricid earthworms that are non-native to North American soils. Our goals were to determine the effects of the co-invasion of A. tokioensis and A. agrestis in woodlands in Madison, WI, U.S. on the soil bacterial community and related edaphic characteristics including soil carbon, nitrogen, and aggregation. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we found that the activity of these Amynthas species earthworms affected community composition, with slight decreases in estimated weighted mean predicted 16S rRNA gene copy number, OTU richness and Faithâ€™s phylogenetic diversity. Along with inconclusive evidence regarding homogenization of community compositions and community assembly processes, we found that aggregate formation via A. tokioensis and A. agrestis casting activity does not consistently impose a strong selective filter on the soil bacterial community, nor does the heightened earthworm activity necessarily act to homogenize soil communities via dispersal. Overall increases in soil C and N under Amynthas activity support previous works that indicate enhanced decomposition and incorporation of soil litter, but more work is needed to determine long-term fate of microaggregate-protected C.
